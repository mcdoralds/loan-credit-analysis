# Project Overview

<i>This is an app that uses Python to predict credit risk. I will build and evaluate several supervised machine learning models to analyze a database of financial data and predict a candidate's chance of loan approval using their portfolio.</i>

## Background
Machine learning is the use of statistical algorithms that 'learn' from data patterns to make predicctions. They come in the form of many different models, which are mathematical representations of real life events in the form of data. Results from this project will be interpreted by logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and support vector algorithms. Model performance will be trained and improved through the use of ensemble and resampling techniques. The use of multiple models is called the ensemble method.

Supervised learning uses labeled data, which means the dataset being fed into the algorithm will have defined data points (e.g. income, age, credit history).
