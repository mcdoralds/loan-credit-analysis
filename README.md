# Project Overview

<i>This is an app that uses Python & supervised machine learning to predict a candidate's "credit risk" (ie chances of getting approved for a loan).</i>

## Background

Everyone's in debt, probably. 

The number of personal loans in the US is growing exponentially, and the total outstanding balance in unsecured personal loans breaks its own record annually. We all know there's an incoming recession but the bills never stop rolling in. The interest payment hits you and that credit card balance just won't go down. The little spurts of dopamine you get whenever you buy your weekly trinket at the thrift store is one of the few moments of respite from a life of suffering, so decreasing spending isn't really an option. 

One thought that may cross your mind while navigating this economic hellscape is 'can I take out another personal loan?'

## Purpose 

The purpose of this project is to build a personal finance tool that will support users make more informed personal borrowing decisions. With a more robust understanding of how your loan application would look to a financial institution, you'll have a better idea of your approval chances and your overall credit risk in the eyes of the bank.

Are you a perfect candidate with glistening financial health? 

Or are you poor, filthy, and unworthy of existence, let alone ANOTHER personal loan?
